## LIGHTING INTERVENTIONS IN UNHCR REFUGEES CAMPS

In this project, I coordinated the design process of a CSR project of SIGNIFY (Philips lighting) for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) with multiple stakeholders located around the world: camp field officers in Asia and Africa, HNHCR officer in Asia and Europe, technical specialists in Europe and Latin America.

The scope of the project was to provide UNHCR and its relevant partners with a tool to make a suitable choice of specifications on solar lighting systems for procurement and installation, operation and maintenance, mainly for new lighting interventions but it can be applied also to support the improvement of the existing lighting system in camps.

This is, in turn, to enhance the quality of life, productivity and safety of displaced population settlement sites, during hours of darkness in all possible applications and projects scopes.
