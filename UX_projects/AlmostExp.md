## ALMOST EXPERIMENTAL project

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobrac/Portfolio/master/images/almostExp.webp"/>

The purpose of this project was to promote the HCI master of the University of Trento in an original, alternative and innovative way.

To accomplish this aim we ideated the idea of “HCI Bubble” which is a mobile and inflatable design space that can be temporarily moved and installed outside conventional academic structures, useful for performing research and events by students, researchers, or interested groups, and that can affordably change locations in accord with the necessity of the design activities and academic purpose.

Starting from this Idea we created a website prototype which reflects the “HCI Bubble” as it was already existing; through the prototype was possible to find information about the “HCI Bubble”, checking the list of event performed inside and also information regarding the HCI master course itself.

To generate our Idea we started by applying PACT analysis and subsequently, we outlined the structure of the website through interviews, focus groups and design critique sessions with other students of our Master course.

Based on the outcomes of this UCD methodology, we created a prototype which was evaluated by a questionnaire based on Marc Hassenzahl’s research of hedonic qualities.

Afterwards, we analysed the data in order to find evidence regarding the goodness of our artefact respect to the existing one (the institutional website).
