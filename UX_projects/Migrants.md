## DESIGN FOR MIGRANTS

<img src="https://github.com/gobrac/Portfolio/raw/master/images/focusM.jpg"/>

The aim of this project was to work collaboratively with a local non-governmental organisation called Kaleidoscopio, to develop a product or service aimed to improve the condition of immigrants and refugees located in the urban area of Trento.

Our team of students, together with the asylum seekers developed some solutions (low-fidelity prototypes) that emerged through a Participatory Design approach which actively involved the Users in a process of co-creation of the final product.

**User research methods:**
<ul>
<li>interviews
<li>Focus group
<li>Thinking Aloud


</ul>

**Developing instruments:**
<ul>
<li>Paper Prototyping
</ul>
